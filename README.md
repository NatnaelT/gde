Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equations

This repository is a work in progress. It contains examples of *Graph neural ordinary Differential Equations* (**GDE**) applied to different tasks. Several documented tutorial notebooks will be included: these notebooks are designed to be clear and useful to practicioners and researchers at all levels of familiarity with *graph neural networks* (GNNs) and *neural ordinary differential equations*. The notebooks contain abundant amounts of comments and all runnable top-to-bottom.

GDEs rely on [dgl](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl) and [torchdiffeq](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq).


## Notebook list:
* `0_1_node_classification_gde`: added
* `0_2_multiagent_forecasting`: work in progress
* `0_3_traffic_forecasting`: work in progress
