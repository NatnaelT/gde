Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equations

```Extension of the graph neural network (GNN) framework to continuous time. Graph neural ordinary differential equations (GDEs) are introduced as the counterpart to GNNs where the input-output relationship is determined by a continuum of GNN layers. The GDE framework is compatible with the majority of commonly used GNN models with minimal modification to the original formulations. GDEs are shown to be effective even in cases where the data is not generated by continuous time processes.```

This repository is a work in progress. It contains examples of *Graph neural ordinary Differential Equations* (**GDE**) applied to different tasks. Several documented tutorial notebooks will be included: these notebooks are designed to be clear and useful to practicioners and researchers at all levels of familiarity with *graph neural networks* (GNNs) and *neural ordinary differential equations*. The notebooks contain abundant amounts of comments and all runnable top-to-bottom.

GDEs rely on [dgl](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl) and [torchdiffeq](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq).
